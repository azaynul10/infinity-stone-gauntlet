## üåü Project Overview

After an exhausting day of 3 final exams in 1 day, I decided to embark on an exciting project instead of resting.

This project combines the power of deep learning with the magic of the Marvel Cinematic Universe!

**Key Features:**
- Real-time hand pose detection using your webcam
- 3D mesh creation of your hand
- Infinity Stone effects based on hand gestures
